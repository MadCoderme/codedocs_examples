## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the `StandardDeviation` class, which calculates the standard deviation of a given set of numbers. 

## Class Overview

The `StandardDeviation` class offers a simple way to calculate the standard deviation of a one-dimensional array of doubles. It provides the following functionalities:

* Calculates the mean (average) of the provided data set.
* Calculates the standard deviation based on the calculated mean.
* Outputs the calculated standard deviation with six decimal places of precision.

## Method Details

### main(String[] args)

This is the main method of the `StandardDeviation` class. It performs the following actions:

1. **Defines a sample data set:** A double array named `numArray` is initialized with sample values.
2. **Calculates the standard deviation:** The `calculateSD` method is called with `numArray` as an argument, and the returned value is stored in the `SD` variable.
3. **Prints the result:** The calculated standard deviation is printed to the console with six decimal places of precision.

### calculateSD(double numArray[])

This method calculates the standard deviation of the provided data set (`numArray`). It performs the following steps:

1. **Calculates the sum of all elements:** It iterates through the `numArray` and adds each element to the `sum` variable.
2. **Calculates the mean:** The `mean` is calculated by dividing the `sum` by the number of elements in the array (`length`).
3. **Calculates the sum of squared deviations:** It iterates through the `numArray` again, calculating the squared difference between each element and the `mean`. These squared differences are added to the `standardDeviation` variable.
4. **Calculates and returns the standard deviation:** The square root of the `standardDeviation` divided by the `length` is calculated and returned as the final standard deviation value.
